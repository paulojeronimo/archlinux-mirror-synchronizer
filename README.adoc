= Arch Linux local mirror synchronizer
:icons: font

This project can be used to locally synchronize an https://www.archlinux.org/[Arch Linux] remote mirror.

The mirror will be synchronized with `$MIRROR_BASE_URL` (see link:config[] file) by calling the link:sync[] script.

The local copy of the mirror will be downloaded in `$MIRROR_BASE_DIR`.
This copy can be HTTP served locally by running the link:serve[] script.
The HTTP server port used by this script is configured in `$HTTP_SERVER_PORT`.

[WARNING]
